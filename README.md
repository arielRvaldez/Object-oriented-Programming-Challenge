## Usage
```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```
## Install
1. Node.js [Version 20.11.0 LTS] https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Jest [Version 29.7] https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
3. Inquirer.js [Version 8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)

## What I Learned
- To build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file or HTML. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, a text for the logo, and saves the generated SVG to a .svg file. 

## Screenshot
The following picture shows application example of logo:
